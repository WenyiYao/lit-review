More than 80 genes, largely impacting mitochondrial energy\\nmetabolism, can underlie LS, and no approved medicines exist. Described 70 years ago, LS\\nwas initially diagnosed by the characteristic, necrotic lesions on autopsy. It has been broadly\\nassumed that antemortem neuroimaging abnormalities in these regions correspond to end-stage\\nhistopathology. However, clinical observations and animal studies suggest that neuroimaging\\nfindings may represent an intermediate state, that is more dynamic than previously appreciated,\\nand even reversible. We review this literature, discuss related conditions that are treatable, and\\npresent two new LS cases with radiographic improvement. We review studies in which hypoxia\\nreverses advanced LS in a mouse model. The fluctuating and potentially reversible nature of\\nradiographic LS lesions will be important in clinical trial design. Better understanding of this\\nplasticity could lead to new therapies.\\nIntroduction\\nLeigh syndrome (LS), also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is the most\\ncommon pediatric manifestation of inherited mitochondrial disorders [1].

Acidosis, as indicated by low serum bicarbonate in patients in\\nthe 1950s and subsequently lactic acidosis found in patients in the 1960s, was the first\\nsalient biochemical observation [3]. Defects in pyruvate metabolism were subsequently\\ndocumented in several patients with LS. Although defects in pyruvate metabolism were\\ninitially thought to be related to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, this hypothesis was\\nnever proven, and many of these cases were ultimately linked to pyruvate dehydrogenase\\ndeficiency [4]. Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency became the first component of the electron\\ntransport chain (ETC) to be linked to LS in 1977 [5].\\nOur diagnostic approach and molecular genetic understanding of LS have dramatically\\nimproved over the past few decades. LS was diagnosed based on autopsy findings\\ntill the 1970s when the advent of brain contrast tomography (CT) and, subsequently,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabled antemortem diagnosis [6–9]. With advances in\\nbiochemical and molecular genetic testing, scores of mitochondrial biochemical and genetic\\nlesions were linked to LS. Today, LS is widely recognized as the most common pediatric\\nmanifestation of mitochondrial disease, with greater than 80 genes — mostly encoding\\nproteins localized to mitochondria — underlying this syndrome [1].\\nLake et al. have most recently defined LS as i) a characteristic clinical presentation including\\npsychomotor retardation and/or regression with progressive neurologic decline, often in\\na stepwise fashion, with decompensations, frequently with illness, ii) radiologic evidence\\nof LS lesions in the basal ganglia or brainstem nuclei, which appear hyperintense in T2-\\nweighted MRI sequences, iii) biochemical evidence of abnormal energy metabolism, and\\niv) identification of a pathogenic variant in a characteristic gene [1]. ‘Leigh-like’ disease\\nor “LS spectrum” is used to describe cases in which a subset of these features including\\nthe radiographic or histologic findings are fulfilled [1]. At present, the precise sequence\\nof events linking mutations in disease genes to end brain disease is not known. A better\\nunderstanding of this molecular pathogenesis is crucial as, at present, there are no proven\\ntherapies.\\nHere, we review the published literature, present two new clinical cases, and integrate recent\\nanimal studies that collectively suggest that the brain disease in LS may be more plastic than\\npreviously appreciated. In particular, we explore the question of whether the antemortem\\nMRI abnormalities may not fully equate to end-stage pathology and that these radiographic\\nfindings might instead reflect intermediate — potentially reversible — stages of this disease.\\nRadiographic brain lesions in Leigh syndrome\\nHyperintense signals on the T2-weighted MRI sequence can arise from multiple processes,\\nmaking the origin of LS lesion signal abnormalities unclear. Tissues such as cerebrospinal\\nfluid (CSF) that typically have high water content appear bright or white on T2-weighted\\nsequences, whereas brain matter appears in shades of gray varying by composition. LS\\nlesions are T2 hyperintense, as they represent an uncharacteristically bright signal in affected\\nCurr Opin Neurobiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 08.\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscriptWalker et al. Page 3\\nregions [10]. What processes typically produce T2 hyperintensity? Possibilities include\\nhemorrhage, ischemia, neoplasm, infection, and inflammation [10]. Reduced diffusivity on\\nisotropic diffusion mapping (thought to represent cytotoxic edema) [11] has occasionally\\nbeen reported in LS lesions (e.g. the study reported by Bonfante et al. [9]). Notably,\\nhowever, not all studies included this technique; and this abnormality can also represent\\nan artifact of high T2 signal. While the contribution of hemorrhage, neoplasm, or infection\\nto the T2 signal abnormalities in LS can be definitively excluded by autopsy and clinical\\nstudies, the relative contributions of inflammation, edema, loss of plasma membrane\\nintegrity, and/or frank necrosis to high T2 signals remain unknown in both the end-stage\\ndisease and antemortem intermediate states in humans.\\nAlthough LS lesions are quite distinctive, a small handful of hereditary conditions and\\na number of acquired conditions — ranging from toxins, insults, nutritional deficiencies,\\ninfections — can lead to lesions with MRI features resembling LS (Table 1) [1,12–\\n35,54,56]. These mimetics are not only important considerations in the differential\\ndiagnosis, but also promise to provide insight into the etiopathogenesis of LS.\\nThe rare LS cases reporting both neuroimaging and subsequent autopsy findings are\\ninstructive and reveal histologic evidence of edema and capillary proliferation, gliosis,\\nand — to a lesser extent — inflammation. Kissel et al. [36] reported an apparent adult-\\nonset LS case with progressive T2 prolongation signal changes of the cerebral peduncles,\\nperiaqueductal gray, and basal ganglia with initial expansion, followed by contraction of\\nthe latter. Microscopic evaluation on autopsy reviewed capillary proliferation and gliosis\\nin regions with relative neuronal preservation, as well as lipid-laden macrophages in\\nareas of complete neuronal replacement by cavitation and necrosis. All areas affected on\\nhistopathologic examination were also detected on MRI [36]. Koch et al. [7] reported a case\\nof twin infants with LS where CT scan lesions observed in late stages also correlated with\\nloss of cellularity, vascular engorgement, and gliosis on autopsy.\\nResolution of radiographic brain lesions in patients with Leigh syndrome\\nSerial imaging has at times demonstrated regression of some radiographic LS lesions.\\nIndeed, as early as 1985, Koch et al. reported the aforementioned case of twins diagnosed\\nwith LS on head CT. In that study, some of the lesions appeared to regress on repeat\\nimaging. Initial CT demonstrated hypodensities of the bilateral basal ganglia and midbrain\\ntegmentum at age 10 months. The basal ganglia lesions were not, however, apparent on\\nrepeat imaging at 17 months despite persistent decline in respiratory function. Autopsy\\nperformed on one twin showed that the basal ganglia lesions that had resolved on repeat\\nimaging demonstrated no gross necrosis, only mild neuronal loss, capillary proliferation,\\nand reactive astrocytosis. However, in the brainstem, where imaging abnormalities had\\nbeen persistent, there was ‘significant’ loss of cells, vascular ‘engorgement,’ and ‘marked’\\nreactive astrocytosis [7]. These findings led the authors to hypothesize that ‘active lesions\\nwith vascular proliferation’ but without frank necrosis might appear and subsequently\\nresolve [7,8]. Intriguingly, recent reports of arterial spin labeling in patients with LS indicate\\nincreased blood flow to LS regions during acute symptomatic crises [37]. Others have\\nsimilarly observed radiologic improvement of T2 signal abnormalities without evidence of\\nCurr Opin Neurobiol.

Page 4\\nnecrosis in various cohorts [9,38,39] and in case report format (Table 2). These findings\\nsuggest that LS lesions that regress on repeat imaging potentially correspond to intermediate\\npathologic states rather than end-stage necrotic lesions.\\nWe report two new cases of transient LS brain lesions. Case 1 is a 10-year-old girl\\nwho first presented at age 9 months with failure to thrive and stridor. The MRI brain\\nobtained at that time revealed T2 hyperintense bilateral lesions of the caudate nuclei and\\nputamina, thalami, and red nuclei. CSF lactate was elevated at ∼5 mM. DNA sequencing\\nrevealed compound heterozygous mutations in mitochondrial complex I (CI) assembly\\nfactor NDUFAF3 (c.489_490delTG and p.Y11D). She began taking α-Tocotrienol quinone\\nin a clinical trial as a toddler and continues on this medication. At age 4 years, she was\\nnonambulatory but had made significant developmental progress, with 2–3 spoken words\\nand the ability to point to multiple people or body parts on command. The T2 half-Fourier\\nsingle-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) brain sequence demonstrated the decreased total area\\nof T2 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia lesions and apparent regression of basal ganglia,\\nthalami, and red nuclei signal abnormalities (Figure 1A). Case 2 is a 9-year-old boy who\\ninitially presented at age 16 months with ataxia, decreased arousal, and seizures. The MRI\\nbrain at that time demonstrated bilateral, symmetric T2 hyperintensities of the dentate\\nnuclei, and lactate peaks on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Enzyme and genetic testing\\nconfirmed defects in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunit PDHA1 (hemizygous\\np.L5P), and ketogenic diet was initiated. The repeat MRI brain at age 4 years showed\\ninterval decrease in T2 hyperintense lesions (Figure 1B). At age 8 years, he speaks in full\\nsentences and ambulates independently.\\nWe identified more than 32 published cases of LS with radiographic resolution of some or\\nall lesions [7–9,38–50,52–54] (Table 2). Age of onset ranged from birth to 22 years. Twenty-\\none patients carried a genetically confirmed diagnosis. Eight patients carried mitochondrial\\nDNA (mtDNA) mutations, 13 had nuclear gene defects, with only two of these occurring\\nin genes functioning outside of the mitochondrion (SLC19A3 [54,55] and TPK1 [56]).\\nTransient lesions were located either in the basal ganglia (18/30), the brainstem (1/30), or\\nin multiple brain regions (basal ganglia and the brainstem [4/30], basal ganglia and thalami\\n[1/30], basal ganglia and the cerebellum [4/30], the brainstem and thalami [2/30]). Although\\nmost cases describe bilateral regression of lesions, asymmetric resolution of caudate lesions\\nwas observed in two patients. Transient lesions often recurred in the setting of illness or\\nmetabolic crises, which are well known to be preciptants of disease progression [40,41,48].\\nAmong published cases, 16 patients’ improved MRIs coincided with clinical improvement\\nat the time of publication [8,38,40,42–46,48,49,52–54]. In some cases, this improvement\\nwas coincident with a treatment including ketogenic diet [38,44], rapamycin/steroids/n-\\nacetylcysteine [52], coenzyme Q10 [49], or biotin and thiamine supplementation [54,57].\\nCritically, no contemporaneous histology has been reported for these intermediate states in\\nwhich T2 hyperintensity had been observed but had later regressed, and the availability of\\nassociated clinical data is variable making it difficult to correlate imaging findings with\\nclinical course.\\nCurr Opin Neurobiol.

Page 5\\nInherited or acquired thiamine deficiency: a special case of treatable lesions in humans\\nOwing to shared features in the disease mechanism (Table 1), clinical presentation,\\nradiographic, and histological findings, comparison of LS to Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome\\n(WKS) — which is often reversible with treatment and comparatively well-understood\\n— merits special attention. WKS results from dietary deficiency of and is treated with\\nsupplementation of the essential vitamin thiamine (B1), which is a coenzyme component\\nfor several mitochondrial enzymes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a known\\ngenetic cause of LS [1]. It is increasingly recognized that WKS has two phenotypes: one\\narising purely from nutritional deficiency; and a nutritional deficiency in the setting of\\nalcohol use disorder [31]. The former presents in the acute phase (Wernicke encephalopathy)\\nwith hearing loss in addition to the classic triad of confusion, oculomotor dysfunction, and\\nataxia, although hearing impairment is not a feature of alcohol use disorder-related disease\\n[58]. In WKS, T2 hyperintensities are found in the bilateral mammillary bodies, thalami,\\ntectal plate, and periaqueductal gray matter. Notably, nonalcohol use disorder patients —\\nwho are more frequently pediatric — may additionally have signal abnormalities of the\\nbasal ganglia, particularly the putamina [31]. The mammillary bodies are uniformly affected\\nin WKS but never to our knowledge in LS (Table 1). The radiographic appearance and\\npostmortem histology of WKS and LS are similar, with both characterized by relative\\nneuronal sparing and striking gliosis, but unlike LS, WKS often also demonstrates evidence\\nof prior hemorrhage [59]. With prompt thiamine supplementation [31], most patients with\\nWKS will experience significant clinical recovery, and resolution of brain lesions after\\ntreatment has been reported [60].\\nIntriguingly, although most LS disease genes encode mitochondrial proteins involved in\\nenergy metabolism, two of the genetic causes of LS involve perturbations of thiamine\\nmetabolism (Table 1), raising the possibility of shared pathogenesis between WKS and LS.\\nLS-linked genes SLC19A3 and TPK1 encode the plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins\\nrequired for thiamine transport into cells and its processing, respectively. In contrast to\\nWKS, mutations in these genes lead to lesions in brain regions entirely consistent with LS\\nand comprise the very small subset of treatable forms of LS that exhibit reversibility with\\nhigh doses of thiamine [56,61].\\nImprovement of Leigh syndrome brain disease in a mouse model\\nThe best-characterized animal model of LS is the mitochondrial CI accessory subunit\\nNdufs4 knockout (Ndufs4−/−) mouse developed by the Palmiter laboratory [62]. CI\\ndeficiency is a common cause of LS, and mutations in NDUFS4 can, rarely, cause LS\\nin humans [63]. Ndufs4−/− mice are born at term and show little or no apparent disease\\ntill about 5 weeks when they develop progressive encephalopathy and die around 7\\nweeks [64]. The Ndufs4−/− have reduced body weight and temperature, ataxia, seizures,\\nlethargy, blindness, and irregular breathing [64,64,65]. These mice typically develop\\nbilateral symmetric gray matter lesions in the brainstem (vestibular nuclei), cerebellum,\\nand olfactory bulb. Although the neuroanatomy of these lesions is consistent with the\\naforementioned definition of LS [1], vestibular nuclei lesions have also specifically been\\nreported in humans [68], and cerebellar lesions are a common feature in patients with\\nLS, it is notable that these mice do not exhibit lesions in the basal ganglia [64].

Page 6\\nto humans, the Ndufs4−/− lesions are characterized by gliosis with prominent microglial\\nactivation, vascular proliferation, neuronal loss, and vacuolation [64]. Furthermore, the\\nlesions identified by histopathology correlate with T2-weighted MRI hyperintensities [65].\\nOther murine mitochondrial encephalopathy models have been reported [69–72], but the\\ncorrelation of the histopathology with radiologic findings has only been firmly established\\nfor the Ndufs4−/−.\\nMultiple therapeutic approaches have been tested in the Ndufs4−/− mouse. Recent gene\\ntherapy strategies to re-express mouse Ndufs4 systemically restored lifespan and healthspan\\nin the Ndufs4−/− [73]. Repletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) provided\\nmoderate extension of the the Ndufs4−/− lifespan from 60 to 100 days [74,75]. Interestingly,\\nectopic expression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 in the brain rescued the lifespan\\nof the brain-specific Ndufs4 knockout, but the mice still had severe ataxia [76]. It is unclear\\nwhether the beneficial effect of NDI1 is specific to restoring NAD+ redox balance or of\\nother downstream effects of electron transport chain inhibition (i.e. redox of the coenzyme\\nQ pool, oxygen consumption, proton pumping by downstream complexes, or mitochondrial\\nATP). Surprisingly, targeting reactive oxygen species with a potent antioxidant (KH176)\\n[77] or transgenic expression of metallothionein 1 [78] had no effect on lifespan. Rapamycin\\nand doxycycline improved healthspan and doubled the lifespan of Ndufs4−/− [79–82].\\nThe most powerful intervention to date in this model, comparable to gene therapy,\\nhas been chronic, continuous exposure to mild hypoxia (11% oxygen), which led to a\\ndramatic extension of lifespan and healthspan, with these mice now living for more than\\n270 days. Moreover, radiologic (T2 MRI signal abnormalities) and histologic staining of\\nneuroinflammatory microglial marker ionized calcium binder adaptor moleculare-1 (IBA1)\\nshow no evidence of the lesions in hypoxia-treated mice [83,84]. Although rapamycin,\\ndoxycycline, and hypoxia prevent neuroinflammation, anti-inflammatory drug tacrolimus\\nhad no beneficial effect [79] suggesting that the mechanism(s) of action of successful\\ninterventions go beyond blocking inflammation. To our knowledge, spontaneous recovery or\\nreversal — partial or complete, by imaging or histology — has never been documented in\\nthis mouse model.\\nTreatment of Ndufs4−/− with hypoxia (11% oxygen) initiated at advanced disease (7 weeks),\\nwhen the mice present advanced symptoms including radiologic abnormalities and are\\nclose to fulfilling humane euthanasia criteria, clinically reverses disease and rescues the\\nmice by improving their overall body weight and motor function, as well as substantially\\nextending their lifespan. Given the uniformly progressive nature of the disease in this mouse\\nmodel and that neurodegeneration has been reported at this timepoint [64], this dramatic\\nimprovement was surprising. Remarkably, in addition to clinical improvement, T2 MRI\\nhyperintensities progressively decrease till they become almost undetectable after one month\\nof hypoxia treatment, which correlates to a substantial reduction of neuroinflammation in\\nhistopathology at this age [84] (Figure 2).\\nAlthough the mechanism of LS lesion improvement in the Ndufs4−/− remains unknown,\\npartial reversibility in WKS disease rodent models has been reported. In a thiamine-deficient\\nmouse model, thiamine treatment prevented further neuroinflammation and neuronal death\\nCurr Opin Neurobiol.

Page 7\\nonly when administered before extensive neuronal loss occurs [85], indicating that treatment\\nhalts disease progression but does not fully reverse it, suggesting that inflammation\\npreceding necrosis may be amenable to intervention. Differences in the ‘lesion age’\\nmay explain why thiamine treatment in the analogous rat model normalized radiologic\\nhyperintensities in the thalamus and colliculi but not in mammillary nuclei and lateral\\nventricles [86]. Unlike thiamine rescue in WKS models, pathologic phenotype, imaging\\nabnormalities, and histology are all ameliorated by hypoxia even when it is implemented at\\nvery advanced disease stages and does not restore the primary CI biochemical defect in the\\nNdufs4−/− [83].\\nRadiographic improvement in lesions in the Ndufs4−/− has also been achieved\\nexperimentally with other interventions that reduce brain oxygen delivery including anemia\\nand administration of sublethal carbon monoxide but not with constitutive activation of\\nthe hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway [87]. Ndufs4−/− mice exhibit a high partial\\npressure of brain oxygen, and hyperoxia worsens disease, potentially reflecting reduced\\noxygen extraction by brain mitochondria [87], a finding reminiscent of the decreased oxygen\\nutilization observed in patients with mitochondrial myopathies [88].\\nFuture outlook\\nIn the 70 years since the initial description of LS, the field has made tremendous progress\\nboth in antemortem diagnosis enabled by MRI imaging and in defining more than 80\\ngenetic causes for this disease. Although we typically think about LS as being a uniformly\\nprogressive and lethal disease, as we have discussed, there are a growing number of clinical\\ncase reports and now mouse models that support the notion that some of the antemortem\\nimaging abnormalities observed in LS may not represent end-stage disease but may in fact\\nrepresent an intermediate state in the disease that is far more dynamic and even reversible.\\nIn particular, mouse studies suggest that neuroinflammation is one of the features that is\\nreversible and correlates with phenotypic and radiographic improvement.\\nAt present, we do not have a clear understanding of how inherited mutations in any\\nof greater than 80 different genes can lead to radiographically supported LS. Key\\nopen questions are as follows: (1) which are the dynamic neuropathological features\\nof LS lesions evidenced by T2 MRI (e.g. neuroinflammation, edema)? (2) in addition\\nto neuroinflammation, which aspects of intermediate disease are reversible? (3) why do\\ninfections or illness precipitate these lesions on imaging? (4) is there a critical treatment\\ntime window before irreversible tissue damage sets in? (5) is improvement caused by\\nremoval of pathogenic drivers (e.g. excess oxygen), by halting neuropathological effects of\\nmitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. neuroinflammation), or instead by activating brain repair\\npathways?\\nThe answers to these important questions remain unknown, but a detailed study of the\\nhuman and mouse model literature yields a handful of common themes. As expected,\\nrepletion of cofactor deficiencies such as thiamine correlates temporally with brain lesion\\nimprovement in humans and rodents. It has also been shown that interventions to either\\nbuffer consequences of oxidative phosphorylation defects (e.g. redox imbalances) or\\nreduce energetic demands (e.g. via mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition)\\nCurr Opin Neurobiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 08.\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscript\\nAuthor\\nManuscriptWalker et al. Page 8\\ncan delay brain disease and extend life in the mouse. Finally, capillary proliferation on\\nhistopathology and hyperperfusion of lesions during crises in humans supports a role for\\nbrain microvasculature in LS irrespective of genetic etiology. Strikingly, the radiographic\\ndifferential diagnosis for LS lesions (Table 1) includes multiple processes in which\\npathogenic vasogenic edema — which may be associated with inflammation — has been\\nimplicated. These findings are of course insufficient to determine if hyperperfusion or any\\nof its resultant effects — notable excess oxygenation — is causal or merely secondary\\nfindings in LS. However, bench research has produced exciting evidence that the presence of\\nlocal hyperoxia — presumably unused oxygen substrate in the setting of deficient oxidative\\nphosphorylation — may be driving disease progression and that removing it by various\\nmechanisms improves disease phenotypes, neuroimaging, and even histology after disease\\nonset. Having mouse models that share biochemical, histopathological, and radiographic\\nfeatures of LS combined with interventions that can tune the dynamics of the lesion will be\\na valuable resource to start addressing the key questions to understand and hopefully harness\\nthe dynamic nature of LS lesions for treatment.\\nFinally, it is critical to appreciate the dynamic nature of LS brain lesions in the context\\nof therapeutic discovery and approval. If the underlying biology of the intermediate states\\nof disease and their reversibility can be understood, it could imply that we can identify\\nrisk factors to be avoided and hopefully new medicines that directly target this biology\\nfor treating the scores of patients. Although such interventions may not fix the proximal\\ngenetic lesion, they could be very powerful in preventing disease progression. Mitochondrial\\ndiseases are extremely rare and heterogeneous, and although interventions in the past have\\nbeen coincident with recovery in LS, we emphasize that most of the cases of radiographic\\nimprovement that we have reviewed here (Table 2) occurred spontaneously (e.g. studies\\nreported by Koch et al. [7], Koch et al. [8], Arii and Tanabe [39], Sofou et al. [41], Roig et\\nal. [43], and Alves et al. [50]). This underscores the need for proper natural history studies\\nand rigorous control arms in clinical trials [89].\\nPatient cases\\nWritten consent to publish case information was obtained from patients.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors thank Darryl DeVivo, Mel B.
